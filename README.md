## Udacity Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship Challenge - Cloud Track 

Hello Everyone to the Bertelsmann Challenge - Cloud Track!

This is a simple github practice assignment: make any changes to this repository. I suggest you challenge yourselves! Some ideas: 

- Create your own named branch e.g branch name can be : juhil-practise or abc-practise
- Cherry-pick my commit, it is simple portfolio over master branch you guys can copy paste the same or can do following changes 
- Upload some files like html, js
- Do few commits
- Fetch the latest commits
- Pull in your branch
- Rebase it
- Delete the commits
- Change the commit messages 
- and so on..
